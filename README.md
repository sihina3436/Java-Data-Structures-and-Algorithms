# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

📚 A collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** implemented in **Java**.  
This repository is designed for learning, practicing, and preparing for **coding interviews** and **competitive programming**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Implementation of common **Data Structures** (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
- Popular **Algorithms** (Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy, etc.)
- Well-structured **Java code** with clear examples
- Beginner-friendly and helpful for interview preparation
